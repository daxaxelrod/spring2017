Yield Curve
    Two bonds with the same liquidiity,
    risk and payment but with different maturities
    Upward sloping log curve

This class is on the 3 theories of yield curves
    And how it gives us the current economic condition

Market Segmentation theory
    We cannot substitute one bond for another

    The short term bonds can perfectly substitute the long term bonds
    rate_1 + rate_1_2^^x / 2


Liquidiity Premium Theory
    Connected market Segmentation and expectation theory
    Long term interest rate should be average of short term interest rates
        Plus a liquidiity premium
