Something is up with my eye

Mid term next Wednesday (one week from today)
    Home work 2 is due on monday

Chapter 5
    How do risk and term structure affect interest rates

3 Theories
    Expectations theory
        Bonds are substituts for eachother even if the maturities are different
        Assume you are going to buy 2 one year bonds vs 1 two year bond
        i long term is the avergae of the short term bond interest rates
    Market Segmentation Theory
        Opposite of Expectations theory
    Liquidiity Premium theory
        There is a liquidiity premium added after you average the short term bonds
        increases as the matruity increases

Formula for expectation theory rehashed

Rate 1 is year 1 bond interest rate
Rate 1,2 ^e is the expected 1 year rate a year from now

#not expecation theory??
(1+rate1) (1+rate1,2^e) = (1 + rate2)^2

#expectation theory
Will always overestimate
Rate 2 == (rate1 + rate1,2^e) / 2



Chapter 9
    Not on the test
    What is the fed
    FOMC vs governers and things of that nature
