Why do intereest rates change

Determinants of asset demand
    Wealth
    Expected return
    Risk
        Assume risk averse
    liquidity

Supply and demand in the bond market
    Example
        1 Year discount bond at a face value of $1,000
        return = (face value - price) / PRICE
        price = $950
        return = 5.3%
        Assume demand is 1000 billion
        She then chart the point of 950 on yaxis and 1000
            on the xaxis
        Now assume that the price of the bond decreases to $900
            and the demand for the bond increases to 3000
        She does a similar thing with the price at 850

    Same thing happens with supply
        if you have a decrease in return (increase in price)
            The supply of bonds on the market will increases

What causes a shift in the demand curve
    Wealth increases
        Right shift
    Expected return increases
        Shift to the left
    Inflation increases
        Left
    riskyness increases
        Demand shifts left
    liquidity increases
        You can sell it easier
        Demand shifts to the right

Supply curve shifts
    profitability increases
        Supply shifts left b/c people are more willing to borrow
    Expected inflation increases
        supply increases
    government deficit
        if the government is spending more than its bringin in, it will sell more bonds
        which drives up supply shifting it to the right

She then runs through several exmples of supply and demand curves being affected
