How to value a bond
    Simple interest
        We can use the coupon yield or current yield
        Eg
        Bond 2yrs, Face value = 100
        Coupon rate = 4%
        Simple interest = $4 + $4 = $8
        Coupon yield = First year coupon / face value
        current yield = first year coupon / CURRENT PRICE # also known as ytm

    Compounding interest
        Annual compounding
            Rate r;
            period 1 --- 1 + r
            period 2 --- 1 + r^2
            period 3 --- 1 + r^3
            PV = Fv / (1+r)^n # i must've written this formula 30 times by now
        Semi
            Period 1/2 -- (1 + r/2)
            Period 1   -- (1 + r/2)^2

        Calculate ytm given PRICE
        price = 120
        i/y = 4%
        ($4 / 1+ YTM) + (4 + $100)/ (1 + YTM)^2 = 120

Simple Loan
    Fixed payment loan like a mortgage
    FV = $1000
    n = 25
    pmt = $85.81

Discount bond
    Buying a bond at a discount price
    YTM = FV - PV / PV
