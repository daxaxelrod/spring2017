Goes over the residual theory of dividends
    Its just net income - whatever capital you need for capital investments
    They you just pay out the remainder as dividends

dividend Irrelevance theory
    No frictions in this world
    paying out dividends has not effect on value to shareholders

    Image a company with one shareholder and 1 share
        If that share generates a single dollar in income over 10 years

        dividends paid are 100% of FCF
            Value to shareholder is $1/year or $10
        If the fcf is retained as earnings
            Value to sharehold accumulates within the firm
