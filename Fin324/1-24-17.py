arrived a little late
traffic was awful but i should have left a bit earlier
Note: estimateing beta not on exam

Slide 29
    Wacc is 15%         Required Rate           IRR
        project A           20%                 17%
        B                   15%                 18%
        C                   10%                 12%
        Using wacc, pick a and b
        using IRR you pick b and c

        Using wacc, we are accepting riskier projects and rejecting safer ones

    If firms take riskier projects consistantly, the riskiness of the firm is going to
    increase in the long term

    The cost of capital for the company will also go up

    Some times wacc just doesnt work

Project risk differentiation
    beta of a company considers both business risk and financial risk
    Beta of comparable firms might not be accturate because financial risk is involved in the calculation
        Consider a company has no debt and another company has a 110% d-e ratio
    We must unlever Beta
    Beta unlevered == Beta / (1 + (1-Tc) D/E)
    2 tools
    1 The pure play approach -- also known as a comparables
        find one or more companies that specialize in the product or service that we are considering
        compute or research the beta for each company
        take the average
        use that beta along with capm to find the appropriate return for a project of that identical risk
        use this computed cost of capital for capital budgeting
    2 the subjective approach
        Consider the projects risk relative to the firm's o'verall risk
        if the project has more risk than the firm, use a discount rat higher than wacc
        opposite for lower risk project

Flotation Costs
    they are fees paid to issue stocks or bonds
    Basic approach
        computed weighted average flotaion cost

    slide 35
        250k for 7 years
        pmt = 250k, n=7 i/y = 15%
        pv = 1,040,104.93
        npv = ^^^ - million bucks upfront
        npv = 40,104.93
        Floatation costs --- equity = 5% ----- debt = 3% ------ d/e = 0.6

        d/e = .6
        since debt and equity is the total value of the firm 1 + d/e = 1.6
        (e + d)/e = V/e
        where v is the value of the whole firm
        e/v = 1/1.6
        d / v = 0.6 / 1.6

        Then 5% (1/1.6) + 3% (0.6/1.6) == 4.25%

        Total cost of project 1,044,386
        the floataion costs are 4.25% of the LARGER NUMBER (Thanks dan smith)

    Slide 38
        Wacc == 9.79
        ^^ this is when we do it on our own

    Does an example from chapter 14
