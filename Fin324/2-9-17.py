Pecking order theory was discussed last class
Absent last class as well
Donaldson 1961
    Managers perfer to finance with retained earnings
        Then with debt followed by equity

Recap of what we'v'e done so far
    ***Capital Structure theory***
        MM theory without taxes -- Miller and Modenomy <- butchered the second name
        :firm value is independent of the capital structure
        : Wacc is not dependent on capital structure
            levered beta is a function of unlevered beta
        : cost of equity can be written as risk free rate + Beta(1 + debt/ equity)(Market risk premium)

    ***Trade off theory of capital structure***
    value of levered firm = value unlevered + debt interest * tax rate - (Cost distress and bankruptcy)

    ***Pecking order theory***
        Considers frictions
        -> Adverse selection
            Firms try to rely on internal funds first
            Debt next and equity as a last resort
        -> transaction costs
        Evidence for pecking order
            Tax benifits from debt. $1 debt adds $.10 to value
            Graham argues that a typical firm can double tax benefits by issuing more debt
            Why its not .35 and is .10
                There are costs with taking more debt
                Bankruptcy costs and financial distress are important
                Some financial people state that for a BBB firm, the NPV of ditress 4.5% of pre-distress value

Value of unlevered firm = Ebit (1-T)/ Rate(u)
