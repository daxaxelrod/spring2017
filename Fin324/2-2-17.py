In the last class
    we started with a company that doesnt have any debt in is capital structure
    With debt would give higher eps in future years

From the 1958 Theory
Main takeaway is that capital structure really isnt that relavant
    The operating cfs are not effected
The cost of equity increases linearly with the debt to equity ratio


So the only way to increase the value of the firm is to increase the value of the cashflows
or minimize the wacc
