Going through chapter 10
Capital budgeting and cash flows
    Not about capital budgeting rules

Relevant cash flows
    The cash flows should only be accepted in capital budgeting are only
    if the project is accepted

    These cash flows are called incremental cash flows or marginal cash flows
    Stand alone principle allows us to analyze each project in isolation

Common types of cash flows
    Sunk costs -- costs that have accrued in the past
        Not relevant because you have to pay regardless
    opportunity cost -- costs of lost options
        Suppose that you buy a piece of land 10 years ago for 10g
        new project needs that land
        the market value of the land
        it is taken into account
    changes in net working capital
        also relevant
    Financial costs
        cash flows / 1 + wacc
    Taxes
        relevant because we have to pay if we generate a profit

Side effects
    Positive side effects -- benefits to other projects
    negitive side effects --  costs to other projects

depreciations expense should be the one used by the irs for tax purposes

MACRS == num years + 1
