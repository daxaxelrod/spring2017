Going to go through the case
    My group presents next thursday
    In lecture 1 there is a framework on how to write the case

Wrigley Jr. Company was the worlds largest manufactureer and seller of chewing gums
    Case written in 2001
    brands include orbit, juicy fruit, altoids, big league chew and double mint

Chewing gum industry
    Extremely competitive
    Dominated by a few large players 50-60% of volume produced by a few players

Revenue grew at 10% and earnings at 9%
    Foreign sales is 58% of profit

conservativly financed
    No debt at the end of 2001
    Founding family had a controlling stake
        Dual class shares

Some hedgefund named aurora borealis swoops in
    In 2002 Some manager thing they can increase gains by adding corporate debt to wriglets balance sheet
    under her plan
        issue 3 billion in debt
            either issue 3 billion in dividends
            or authorize share buybacks

Questions to answer
    Write a problem statement
    Should Wrigley pursue the $3 billion debt recapitalization proposal? In particular,
        Should it issue the $3 billion corporate bond?
        Does the recapitalization result in an “optimal capital structure”?
        What would you recommend on the debt-equity mix?

    Find optimal debt amount

    Share repurchase has other ramifications
        Including ownership and market responses

    Consider impact of
        Share value
            Debt rating
            Voting control
        Cost of capital
            eps

This is not a new problems
    There are comps out there

Ways to consider the pv of distress
    1.Can we ignore this with appealing arguments?

    2.Guess From the debt ratings
        Calculate cost of equity and then get the difference between that and a triple a rated bond
        Singifies the expected risk of distress or bankruptcy
        Be careful because if you find this difference to eb 4-5%, there may be other factors
