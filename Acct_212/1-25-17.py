IMA (institue of managerial accounting)
    Has some sort of ethics code
    Without a code of ethics, you won't s'urvive
    compete on a fair and open playing field

You have to be competant at what you do. you must maintain a high level of
expertise and skill

CPE - continueing professional education
Confidentiality
    Dont share information
    duh

If you have an ethical conflict, go to your supervisor
If therer is a clear violaion of the law, just go to the feds

Chapter 1 - Cost flows
#########

Product costs and period costs
Inventory does not appear on the income statement until its sold
We capture out product costs in inventory

if you spend 1 million to make something and dont sell it, you have no expenses
Only when you sell something do the expenses count
That 1 million live in inventory

SGA is always taken out in the income statement
    not attached to the product
