How do we assign costs to costs objects
    direct
        easily traced to objects
            Eg direct material and direct labor
            direct labor is not counted in how much you pay the laboror
        the right way to calculate a unit of direct labor
        
    Indirect
        Costs cannot be easily and conveniently traced to a unit of production
            Eg Manufacturing overhead
            When we talk about indirect costs, they are not SG&A costs
