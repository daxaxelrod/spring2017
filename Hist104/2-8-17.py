    How did white southerners retain power in the south

Plessy V Ferguson
    Plessy was 1/8th black
        Called an octaroon
    Boarded a train
    Goes onto the train hoping to be arrested
        Wanted to challenge an act called the seperate car act (People of color gets different cars)
    He told the conductor that he was 1/8th black and then refused to move black
    Comes before the supreme court in 1896
    Segregated cars called jim crow cars
    8 out of 9 judges said that seperate but equal was constitutional

South in the industrial era
    Destruction was cray
        1/3 of all buildings were destroyed
        Lagged behind north
    Enters era 4 decades behind north
    South makes up only 10% of national manufacturing output by 1900
    20% of southern taxes paid pensions for confederate war vets
        Jackasses

Attempts to industrialize
    People who want to industrialize the south and create a new south
        Henry Grady (Big fan of new south)
    Others want to be stagnant and maintain agriculture as a main source of income

    Attempts to convince northerners that the south is now civilized and is done with slavery and secesion
        And thus less risk than initially perceived

South tries
    Uses prisons for free labor
    free land for railroads
    Birmingham alabama started making a crap ton of pig iron

    Other major industries include tobacco and textiles
        Wages were much lower than in the north

Jim crow
    Not an actual guy
    Was an offesnsive character and then became main stream

        Grandfather clause (Your grandpa had to be able to vote for you to vote)
        Literacy tests (Pretty obvious what this one is)
        All white primaries (Only whites can run for office)
        Williams v Mississippi upheld the restrictions outlined above

        By 1910, only 3% of blacks were eligible to vote
    Economic
        Sharecropping
        Crop lien system

            Small number of black cops and firefighters
        Too many lynchings
            Between 1885-1918, roughly 5000 blacks murdered because of violations of racial codes

    Atlanta Compromise Speech

        Pleads african americans to wait for equality and to work their way up the social ladder
        "Cast down your bucket where you are"
            We are a great source of labor for your industrial dream o white southerners

    Ida B Wells
