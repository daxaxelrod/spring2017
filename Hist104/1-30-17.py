Maps in the late 19th centrury shows the west as empty and fit for conquest

post civil war, west seems like an area of opportunity
    #just like space is going to be after wwIII
    Maniest Destiny == God says fucking go for it

Reality of the west
    Was not as empty as people thought it was
    more urban than east because of central infrastructure (people lived near trains)
    depended on federal government
        especially true for railroads
        gave railroads 175 million acres

Why people move west

    mining
    ranching
